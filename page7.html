					<h2><span>HOME GARDEN DEVELOPMENT IN KOCHI CORPORATION, KERALA</span></h2>
					
					<p class="mt-4" > To assess the biodiversity of home gardens in Cochin Corporation a detailed survey had been conducted during the
                        period of September 2020 to April 2021. Stratified random sampling was carried out among 12 wards from a total of 74 administrative
                        divisions. A total of 10% of households were surveyed from selected wards using semi structured questionnaires. Information regard
                        ing floral diversity in home gardens and basic personal information were collected. A total of 1717 Households from these were surveyed.
                        570 species of plants were recorded from the study area including 7 species which are endemic to Western Ghats and Santalum album and
                         Saraca asoca which are listed as Vulnerable under IUCN Red List.

                        Invasive plants were discovered in 4.04 percent of the households were examined. Invaders were recognised as 23 species and 14 families,
                         with a significantly higher number of species planted and the rest growing naturally. Although endemic and endangered species make only 
                        a small percentage of the garden flora, their efforts collectively over entire urban ecosystems have enormous potential. Cultivation of
                        these species, on the other hand, is done for economic reasons rather than for environmental conservation. The plants cultivated in home 
                        gardens were suggested to be an important source of nutrition supplement, providing economic benefits, culturally and medicinally import
                        ant to the respondents. Sociodemographic characters were also considered as a strategy for evaluating the nature and background status of
                        the households. The majority of people were discovered to protect the diversity of plants in their local community by collecting seeds 
                        from their home gardens; ornamental plant propagation was also discovered to be primarily done by stem cuttings, and hydroponics was pra
                        ctised by a small percentage of the respondents. 
                        
                        People maintain gardens in urban contexts for a variety of reasons, including aesthetics, time and space efficiency, economic rewards, 
                        and access to food and medicine. Invasive species have been discovered to have a role as a decorative plant in residential gardens. The 
                        presence of endemic and vulnerable species in the research area suggests that the urban landscape might serve as a conservation space and
                        should be conserved. Home gardens were the premises for vegetable farming because the urban environment can be employed as a perfect site
                        for planting, as we assumed. People took up gardening as a hobby. Biodiversity of urban areas can also be accessed from these home gardens.
                        In the light of all these, greater attention is necessary to protect and develop home gardens especially in urban areas and it is necessary
                        to make the people aware of its importance in our contemporary world.
